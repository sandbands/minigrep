**minimal grep**: a command line tool written in rust.

## Brief

**minimal grep** *or* `minigrep` is a command line tool written in rust.

I created this project following The Rust Book's instructions and I may expand on it later, making it not-so-minimal grep. For now, this repository will contain the version of minigrep that was developed in the way i was told to by The Rust Book, but I plan to make something original out of it in the future--something that is my own.
